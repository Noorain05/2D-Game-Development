# 2D-Game-Development

## Introduction 👋
This project consists of making a 2D game with the help of either Unity or Godot game engines. I have choosed Godot to make a platformer with combat system which has decent mechanics, though the one here **DOES** not represent the final project. I will be adding more features to the game as I progress (I have added almost all the things I learned in the tutorials and I will keep adding as I learn). Also I am a huge of the Dark Souls series so please bear with me if the game seams too difficult. 😅

## Instructions for Installing 🔧
Just download the .exe file and you are good to go.
I have also added the source files for those interested. 😄

## Controls 🎮
- Move Left : A or ◀️
- Move Right : D or ▶️
- Jump : Spacebar  
If the game feels too slow you can try pressing Shift for some fun. 😉

## Future Improvements 🚀
* A Main Menu
* Capability of attacking mobs
* 1v1 Boss Battles
* More Levels (Better than the one here)
* Enemies with AI to track to the player than attack
* NPCs
These are the things I have decided right now to add in the future and I will try my best to add as many as I can. 😊
